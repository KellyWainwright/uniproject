								<h1>Overfishing: The death of our oceans’ marine life</h1>
								<p>Overfishing occurs when too many fish are caught in a particular area over a short space of time. This causes the breeding population to decrease to levels that are unable to recover, until there are none left to catch. It is often related to commercial fishing vessels that catch vast amounts of unwanted fish or other animals, as these unwanted fish, known as “bycatch”, die unnecessarily, and are then thrown back into the ocean as waste. Prolonged and widespread overfishing means that nearly a third of the world's fisheries are now in deep trouble, and this number is likely an underestimate, as many fisheries remain unstudied (<a href="https://www.edf.org/oceans/overfishing-most-serious-threat-our-oceans" target="_blank">Environmental Defence Fund</a>, no date). </p>

								<p>The global demand for fish is suffocating our oceans. In 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2020, pp. 2-5), estimated that global fish production reached an immense 179 million tonnes, with numbers rising, and this huge demand for fish has led to 55% of the Earth’s oceans being fished in some form (Hentz, D., 2018).</p>
								<p>However, it is not the demand for fish that is the main cause of overfishing, it is poor fishing management.</p>
								<p>Around the world, many fisheries are driven by rules that make the problem of overfishing worse, or have no rules at all, so prolonged and widespread overfishing has led to nearly a third of the world's fisheries now being in deep trouble, and this number is likely an underestimate, as many fisheries remain unstudied (Environmental Defence Fund, no date).</p>
								<p>This problem is amplified, as less than 7.7% of the oceans are marine protected areas (Protected Planet, no date), meaning that fishing can take place without restrictions in over 92% of our oceans. </p>
								<p>If fishing can happen to this extent across so much of our oceans, it is clear why overfishing is such a big problem; demand for fish is rising, more of the oceans are being fished, and marine wildlife is suffering. </p>

								<p>One major impact of overfishing is bycatch, as it is near to impossible to avoid catching unwanted marine life in fishing nets. It is estimated that bycatch makes up over 40 percent of the total global marine catch and includes endangered animals such as sea turtles and seals, who’s conservation is of critical importance (Environmental Progress, no date).</p>
								<p>Bycatch has been a persistent problem for decades, because it remains largely undocumented, and discarding large quantities of fish can lead to overfishing, prevent populations from recovering, disrupt the natural balance of marine ecosystems, and some valuable overfished populations are unable to recover because of continued high levels of bycatch (Keledjian, A. et al., 2014, p. 8). </p>
								<p>One of the most famous examples of bycatch are dolphins. Dolphins are often found swimming near their food source, tuna, in the Pacific Ocean. Dolphins then get caught in the tuna nets and drown, so any that are released from these nets are usually dead or severely injured (Environmental Progress, no date). A study by Anderson et al. (2020) found that the average abundance of small cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) in the Indian Ocean, is now 87% lower than population levels were before fisheries were introduced. </p>
								<p>Sharks are also impacted by bycatch, as although it is finning (cutting the fins off a shark and discarding the body, often still alive, at sea), that gets the most attention as a threat to sharks, globally the biggest threat is actually bycatch caused by overfishing, as tens of millions of sharks are caught in fishing nets each year, which is a major challenge to shark conservation. The destruction of habitats by fishing nets also plays a part in declining shark populations, which is a vicious cycle, as sharks play vital roles in marine ecosystems, so as their populations rapidly decline around the world, so too does the health of our oceans (Shark Trust, no date). </p>

								<p>Overfishing has many impacts beyond reducing fishing populations. It also endangers ocean ecosystems and impacts the billions of people who rely on seafood as a key source of protein. If fisheries are not sustainably managed, they face collapse, and we face a food crisis (Environmental Defence Fund, no date).</p>
								<p>A report by the WWF (2015, p.6), showed a decline of 49% in marine populations between 1970 and 2012, and if these populations get too low, they can collapse and disappear. This has significant impacts on the ecosystem the population belong to, as well as on the food supply and economy of the areas that rely on harvesting the fish.</p>
								<p>Global fish production is estimated to have reached about 179 million tonnes in 2018, 156 million tonnes of which was used for human consumption, which is an estimated annual supply of 20.5 kg per capita (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2020, pp. 2-5). This coupled with the fact that each year, seafood provides 3.3 billion people with more than 20 percent of their average per capita intake of animal proteins, and is the livelihood to 10% of the global population (Gaines et al., 2018), emphasises just how essential preserving marine populations is to humans. </p>
								<p>A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2016, pp. 5-6), found that over 30% of the world’s fish stocks were overfished, and over 58% were at capacity, meaning over 90% of fishing stocks could be at risk of seeing their populations collapse entirely.</p>
								<p>With only 65.8% of our fisheries being within biologically sustainable levels in 2017 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021), the threat of overfishing is too large to ignore, and the threat of marine life becoming too scare to fish, thus wiping out an entire food source is too much of a threat to ignore.</p>

								<p>It may seem like the problem of overfishing has gone too far to be reversed, but this is not the case. There are many ways of making fishing more sustainable. Most of the world's wild fisheries could be at healthy levels in just 10 years, and global fish populations could double by 2050 with better fishing approaches. By 2050 sustainably managed fisheries could produce 29% more wild fish increase numbers of fish for conservation by 118%. Every major fishing nation stands to benefit, and even though management costs associated with sustainable fishing may rise, the benefits from reforming fisheries always exceed the costs (Costello et al., 2016).</p>
								<p>As consumers, we can buy sustainably certified seafood (usually with the Marine Stewardship Council logo) and be more informed about the origin of our food to make sure it is caught in a sustainable way (Wong, 2020). We can also reduce our fish intake and campaign for and support more sustainable fishing alternatives.</p>
								<p>We must also work to limit carbon emissions, as if global temperatures rise, many fish will respond to warming waters by moving away from the equator, towards the poles and further offshore, and equatorial nations, which are highly dependent on seafood as a source of food and income, will suffer. Tackling sustainable fisheries management and climate change together can result in significant increases of fish, food, and economic activity, and if we can ensure global temperatures do not rise beyond 2° C and put the right fishing measures in place, we can have an estimated 25 billion additional servings of seafood by 2100 (Gaines et al., 2018).</p>
								<p>If no-fish zones were implemented strategically around the world, we could have all the fish we need, and with smarter management systems, known as fishing rights, we can reverse the incentives that lead to overfishing, and fisherman’s’ incomes would improve with fish populations. This has been proven to work and in the Gulf of Mexico after these measures were taken, red snapper populations are three times what they were in 2007 (Environmental Defence Fund, no date).</p>
								<p>Aquaculture, or fish farming, could also be used to dramatically increase the supply of seafood and reduce the environmental harm of fishing. Rather than harvesting wild fish from marine ecosystems, populations are bred and grown in controlled conditions and harvested at a sustainable rate (Environmental Progress, no date), and in 2018, 82 million tonnes of fish production came from aquaculture production (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2020, pp. 2-5). </p>
								<p>Additionally, reducing bycatch is also a solvable problem if we use better techniques such as specialised nets, document all catches, set scientifically based catch limits, and make every effort to avoid it. Reducing bycatch will not only save thousands of marine animals, but also help to rebuild overfished populations and maintain healthy ones (Keledjian, A. et al., 2014, p. 8).</p>
